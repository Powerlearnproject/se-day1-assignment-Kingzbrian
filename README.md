#Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

·       Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

·       Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

#Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

·       Development of programming languages (e.g. C)

·       The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

·       The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

#List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

·       Requirements analysis: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

·       Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

·       Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

·       Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

·       Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.

·       Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

#Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

·       Waterfall: It is a sequential approach to software development which has distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. Can be used when designing a software that is straightforward and is not expected to change.

·       Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Can be used where there is expected to be changes during the development.

#Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

·       Software Developer- writing code for the system or solution to be implemented.

·       Quality Assurance Engineer-ensuring that the software is of high quality by implementing test plans.

·       Project Manager-oversees the whole process from planning to delivery.

#Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

·       Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-eg: visual studio. They provide tools for writing, testing and debugging code.

·       Version Control Systems (VCS)-eg:github- they provide tools for tracking changes to the source code and collaborating with teammates.

#What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

·       Changing requirements-effective communication among the users and the development team.

·       Tight deadlines- prioritizing tasks to save on time thus using agile methodology.

#Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

·       Unit – involves testing of individual components of software.

·       Integration – involves testing of the interactivity between modules and subsystems.

·       System – involves testing of the entire system.

·       Acceptance – involves testing software against the user requirements ensuring it meets their needs.

#Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

·       Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or instructions in way that helps us get the best out of an AI.
#Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

·       Translate “thank you sir”.

·       Translate the following sentence from English to Spanish. “thank you sir”
